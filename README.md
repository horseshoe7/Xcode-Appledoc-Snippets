#Xcode-Appledoc-Snippets

Code Snippets I created for making my life a bit easier when creating documentation using appledoc.  

It's a bit easier to just drag and drop the part of the documentation you want to add.  Small time-saver, don't have to remember the syntax when you're a beginner or haven't done it for a while.

I took inspiration to share my snippets in this way from Matt Thompson [github.com/mattt](http://www.github.com/mattt/Xcode-Snippets).

## Using Snippets

In Xcode 4, open a workspace and toggle the right sidebar to be visible. On the bottom, there is a panel with four icons in the header. Click on the `{ }` icon to open the Code Snippets Library.

Now copy-paste the code from one of these snippets, highlight the code block you just pasted and drag it to the Code Snippet panel. Make sure to match the suggested platform, language, and completion scope. The completion shortcut corresponds to the filename of the code snippet.
